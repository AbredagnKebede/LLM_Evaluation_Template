I need you to prepare comprehensive test suite inside @tests.py  for a code that will be generated by the prompt @prompt.md 

Use prompt.md as a sole context to prepare the tests. The tests must cover all cases, like cases that even the best programer in the world would forget to consider while responding, and also check if any code that is generated by the prompt is exactly in a way told by the prompt. 

The purpose of this tests is to find the failing cases of different implementations of prompt.md and exposing the weakness of the codes(response as the whole).

The tests needs to be atleast 10 but can be more to cover all cases. 

Use unittest only. Assume the functions cited in the prompt are avaliable in the ideal_code.py that is avaliabel in the same dir as tests.py.

Iteratively check all unit tests to make sure they are all correct and asserting the right value. 

The test should look something like:
```python
import unittest
import random
import time
import math
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
# Add other necessary imports based on prompt requirements

from ideal_code import (
    # Import ALL functions mentioned in the prompt
    # Include helper functions if they should be testable
)

class TestImplementationName(unittest.TestCase):
    """
    Comprehensive test suite for [implementation name].
    Tests cover all requirements, constraints, and edge cases to expose implementation weaknesses of the prompt inside `@prompt.md`.
    """
    
    # Test methods here...
```
And the ideal_code that is at the import of the sample test above, assume it is like a code that is the prefect response for the prompt inside @prompt.md, but when generating the test you only depend on the prompt.md not the ideal_code for now.

Please note:
- Do not use intensive inline comments as they seems to be LLM generated. Tests must not look like LLM generated.

I have attached @prompt.md file
